            - least significant bit first (small half is left half, large half is right half if reading chronologically)
                - e.g. - frame number comes from the 0th and 1st bytes of the current frame,
                hour from the 6th and 7th

            - possible frame rates: 23.976, 24, 25, 29.97, 30

            - max value representable with 4 bits, 3 bits, 2bits

            Example:
                - current hour is 12
                - 7th index is hour 10's place, 6th is 1's place

                    - small 1/2 of 7th and 6th bytes of 10 byte (80 bit) long frame

                        7th byte (2 least sig bits) - representing hour 10's place (least to most significant bit):
                        [ 0 0 0 1 ]-0-0-0-0  ->  & 0x03  ->
                        & 0 0 1 1
                        = 0 0 0 1  = decimal value 1

                        6th byte (4 least sig bits) - representing hour 1's place (least to most significant bit):
                        [ 0 0 1 0 ]-0-0-0-0  -> & 0x0F  ->
                        & 1 1 1 1
                        = 0 0 1 0  = decimal value 2

        32 bits are assigned as eight groups/fields/chars of four [USER] BITS (UB)

        32 bits = 4 bytes
        4 bytes / 8 fields = 1/2 byte per field...
        ... = 1x 4-bit binary number per field...

        4 bits allows for a single hexadecimal character per field / UB char (0-F),
        which is the standard format of UB in American film production
